                I'm Tomás, born on April 5, 2005. I have a strong passion for design and storytelling, and I’m continuously expanding my skills in these areas. My primary focus is on UI Design and Game Writing, where I aim to create immersive experiences that blend visual appeal with compelling narratives.

                I enjoy exploring new design trends, refining user interfaces to enhance usability, and crafting engaging game worlds filled with depth and meaning. Although I’m still learning, I’m dedicated to improving my expertise and turning my creativity into impactful projects.
